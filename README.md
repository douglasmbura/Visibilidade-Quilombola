# Visibilidade-Quilombola

**Visibilidade Quilombola**" is a web- based application that was developed in 2020, at the height of COVID 19, to help the Indigenous Quilombola community in Brazil to become more visible by enabling the community to easily and quickly share their story of how Covid-19 was affecting their lives.

Quilombola are the descendants of Afro-Brazilian slaves who escaped from slave plantations that existed in Brazil until abolition in 1888. Due to geographic isolation, limitations to the access of the area in which they live in, and the lack of quality in the service when it is needed,these communities live in precarious health conditions.
 
 The app features the following key components:

1.	A **DASHBOARD** built in R data to provide visualization tool to help the Quilombola community to communicate their data story with the rest of the world-shining a light on their health, economic, cultural and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

2.	A **STORYMAP** which is a scroll-based narration
