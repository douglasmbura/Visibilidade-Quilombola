# Visibilidade-Quilombola
"**Visibilidade Quilombola**" is a web- based application that was developed in 2020, at the height of COVID 19, to help the Indigenous Quilombola community in Brazil to become more visible by enabling the community to easily and quickly share their story of how Covid-19 was affecting their lives.

Quilombola are the descendants of Afro-Brazilian slaves who escaped from slave plantations that existed in Brazil until abolition in 1888. Due to geographic isolation, limitations to the access of the area in which they live in, and the lack of quality in the service when it is needed,these communities live in precarious health conditions.
 
 Quilombola Community Covid19 Response Map is a Demo map that was created in R and intergrated to the "Visibilidade Quilombola" Web application that emerged as winning Application during the 2020 Hack4Covid-19 Hackathon, which was organized by the GEO Indingenous Alliance.

The map is hosted by GitHub and can be found at https://douglasmbura.github.io/Quilombo-R-Map/
